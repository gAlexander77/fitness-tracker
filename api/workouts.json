Lower your torso into a stretch position keeping the neck stationary at all times. This will be your starting position.\n3.  With the hips stationary, flex the waist by contracting the abdominals and curl the shoulders and trunk upward until you feel a nice contraction on your abdominals. The arms should simply slide up the side of your legs if you have them at the side or just stay on top of your chest if you have them crossed. The lower back should always stay in contact with the ball. Exhale as you perform this movement and hold the contraction for a second.\n4.  As you inhale, go back to the starting position.\n5.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** Perform this exercise slowly and deliberately as it takes some getting used to. Also, do not be hasty and try to use weights on the first time; you'll have enough on your hands learning how to balance yourself. Also, if balance is an issue I recommend having a spotter next to you and also placing each of your feet under a 100-lb dumbbell for added stability. As you get more advanced you can hold a dumbbell or a weight plate (held at arms length) on top of your chest. However, you have to be very careful when adding weight to this exercise, because if you add too much too quickly you could get a hernia.\n\n**Variations:** You can perform this exercise with a low pulley behind you with a rope attached on its end. In this manner you can go ahead and add resistance easier. For this variation, you will need to hold on to the sides of the rope throughout the movement. I like to bring my arms forward to the point that the upper arms are almost parallel to my torso and the lower arms are facing back holding the rope.\nThe exercise ball crunch is a popular gym exercise targeting the abdominals.

Your back should be slightly arched and your chest should be sticking out. You should be feeling a nice stretch on your lats as you hold the bar in front of you. This is the starting position of the exercise.\n4.  Keeping the torso stationary, pull the handles back towards your torso while keeping the arms close to it until you touch the abdominals. Breathe out as you perform that movement. At that point you should be squeezing your back muscles hard. Hold that contraction for a second and slowly go back to the original position while breathing in.\n5.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** Avoid swinging your torso back and forth as you can cause lower back injury by doing so.\n\n**Variations:**\n\nYou can use a straight bar instead of a V-Bar and perform with a pronated grip (palms facing down-forward) or a supinated grip (palms facing up-reverse grip).\nThe cable seated row is a popular exercise to train the muscles of the upper back, including the lats (latissimus dorsi), traps, rhomboids, and rear deltoids, using a cable stack. It also targets the biceps to a lesser degree. The cable row can work well in a variety of rep-ranges, but is most popular in muscle-building workouts or as an accessory movement for strength workouts.", "diagram": "https://artifacts.bbcomcdn.com/@bbcom/exercises-app/2.1.2/img/guide-4.gif", "muscle": "Middle Back", "equipment": "Cable, Machine, Other", "images": ["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/originals/2020-xdb-81c-cable-seated-row-m1.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/cropped/2020-xdb-81c-cable-seated-row-m1-crop.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/originals/2020-xdb-81c-cable-seated-row-m2.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/cropped/2020-xdb-81c-cable-seated-row-m2-crop.jpg"], "videos": ["https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/lkTavsq8-1zuboWt3.mp4", "https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/30000/30431l.mp4", "https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/40000/40231l.mp4"]}, {"workoutName": "Bent-arm dumbbell pull-over", "description": "1.

This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack just below shoulder level. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n2.  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3.  Step away from the rack and step forward with your right leg and squat down through your hips, while keeping the torso upright and maintaining balance. Inhale as you go down. Note: Do not allow your knee to go forward beyond your toes as you come down, as this will put undue stress on the knee joint. li>\n4.  Using mainly the heel of your foot, push up and go back to the starting position as you exhale.\n5.  Repeat the movement for the recommended amount of repetitions and then perform with the left leg.\n\n**Caution:** This is a movement that requires a great deal of balance so if you suffer from balance problems you may wish to either avoid it or just use your own bodyweight while holding on to a fixed object. Definitely never perform with a barbell on your back if you suffer from balance issues.\n\n**Variations:** There are several ways to perform the exercise.\n\n*   One way is to alternate each leg. For instance do one repetition with the right, then the left, then the right and so on.\n*   The other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions. Then you switch legs and do the same.\n*   A more challenging version is the walking lunges where you walk across the room but in a lunging fashion. For walking lunges the leg being left back has to be brought forward after the lunging action has happened in order to continue moving ahead. This version is reserved for the most advanced athletes.\nThe barbell forward lunge is a popular lower-body exercise targeting the quads, glutes, and hamstrings. Using a barbell allows you to overload the exercise beyond body weight and perform the movement in strength or muscle-focused rep ranges.

Begin the first pull by driving through the heels, extending your knees. Your back angle should stay the same, and your arms should remain straight. Move the weight with control as you continue to above the knees.\n3.  Next comes the second pull, the main source of acceleration for the clean. As the bar approaches the mid-thigh position, begin extending through the hips. In a jumping motion, accelerate by extending the hips, knees, and ankles, using speed to move the bar upward. There should be no need to actively pull through the arms to accelerate the weight; at the end of the second pull, the body should be fully extended, leaning slightly back, with the arms still extended.\n4.  As full extension is achieved, transition into the third pull by aggressively shrugging and flexing the arms with the elbows up and out. At peak extension, aggressively pull yourself down, rotating your elbows under the bar as you do so. Receive the bar in a front squat position, the depth of which is dependent upon the height of the bar at the end of the third pull. The bar should be racked onto the protracted shoulders, lightly touching the throat with the hands relaxed. Continue to descend to the bottom squat position, which will help in the recovery.\n5.  Immediately recover by driving through the heels, keeping the torso upright and elbows up. Continue until you have risen to a standing position.\n6.  The second phase is the jerk, which raises the weight overhead. Standing with the weight racked on the front of the shoulders, begin with the dip. With your feet directly under your hips, flex the knees without moving the hips backward. Go down only slightly, and reverse direction as powerfully as possible.\n7.  Drive through the heels create as much speed and force as possible, and be sure to move your head out of the way as the bar leaves the shoulders.\n8.  At this moment as the feet leave the floor, the feet must be placed into the receiving position as quickly as possible. In the brief moment the feet are not actively driving against the platform, the athletes effort to push the bar up will drive them down. The feet should be split, with one foot forward, and one foot back. Receive the bar with the arms locked out overhead. Return to a standing position.\nThe clean and jerk is a full-body lift that is one of two contested lifts in Olympic weightlifting competitions. It is comprised of two movements: the clean, where the bar is pulled from the floor and caught in the front rack position in three pulls or phases, followed by the jerk overhead.

It attempts to isolate the chest muscles, stretching and contracting them while limiting involvement of the shoulders. Unlike a press, where the elbows bend and flex, flyes should keep a relatively consistent elbow angle.

For instance do one repetition with the right, then the left, then the right and so on.\n\nThe other way is to do what I call a static lunge where your starting position is with one of your feet already forward. In this case, you just go up and down from that starting position until you are done with the recommended amount of repetitions.

This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\n2.  Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3.  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (**Note:** For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n4.  Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5.  Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the middle of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n6.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes.\n\n**Variations:** As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize. You can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\nThe barbell front squat is a compound movement that emphasizes building the lower-body muscle groups. With the barbell racked in front of the body on the anterior delts, the front squat emphasizes the quads and glutes, but also upper back and core strength to remain upright. Front squats can be trained as an alternative to back squats, as an accessory movement for either squats or deadlifts, or for strength and muscle on their own. Many lifters and athletes prefer them to back squats, although they can be uncomfortable and difficult to learn at first.", "diagram": "https://artifacts.bbcomcdn.com/@bbcom/exercises-app/2.1.2/img/guide-7.gif", "muscle": "Quadriceps", "equipment": "Barbell", "images": ["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/originals/xdb-51b-barbell-front-squat-m1-16x9.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/cropped/xdb-51b-barbell-front-squat-m1-square.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/originals/xdb-51b-barbell-front-squat-m2-16x9.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/cropped/xdb-51b-barbell-front-squat-m2-square.jpg"], "videos": ["https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/KKkz1xZJ-1zuboWt3.mp4", "https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/28000/29301l.mp4", "https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54081l.mp4"]}, {"workoutName": "Alternating dumbbell front raise", "description": "1.

This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n2.  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3.  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a less-than-shoulder-width narrow stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Feet should be around 3-6 inches apart. Keep your head up at all times (looking down will get you off balance) and maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (**Note:** For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n4.  Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5.  Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n6.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\n\n****Variations:****\n\nAs previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\n\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\n\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (**Note:** For wide-stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\n\nAnother way to perform these is by using a weight belt and attaching weights to it in between the legs. This variation is referred to as weight-belt squats which need to be performed with the legs placed on two well secured, raised, but separated platforms, that allow the weights to go up and down in the middle. This exercise is an excellent choice for people with lower back problems. The issue however is finding the platforms that meet the criteria. The only way I have been able to perform this is when I have two benches placed opposite to each other with spotting platforms that are facing each other. If you move the benches close enough then you get can execute the weight-belt squats by using the spotting platform.\n\nFinally, you can also perform squats in a Smith Machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the Smith Machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against Smith Machine use for squats. If you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.\nThe narrow-stance squat is an exercise that targets the lower body with an emphasis on the quads. Many people will find they can't go as deep in a narrow-stance squat as with a wider squat, which is normal.

The handles can be used to monitor your heart rate to help you stay at an appropriate intensity.\n\nEllipticals offer convenience, cardiovascular benefits, and have far less impact on joints than ground-based cardio such as running. A 150 lb person will burn on average 387 calories in 30 minutes, compared to more than 450-700 calories running. It\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s recommended that you use the arms on the elliptical to create more movement, if your elliptical has them.\nThe elliptical trainer is a popular machine for cardiovascular training without the significant impact on your joints of running.

Stand up straight with a flat bench behind you while holding a dumbbell on each hand (palms facing the side of your legs).\n2.  Position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. **Note:** For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section.\n3.  Begin to slowly lower your torso by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n4.  Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n5.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** Be cautious with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. You may use wrist wraps for this exercise.\n\n**Variations:** As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\n\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\n\nYou can also use a barbell for this exercise. Another way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.", "diagram": "https://artifacts.bbcomcdn.com/@bbcom/exercises-app/2.1.2/img/guide-7.gif", "muscle": "Quadriceps", "equipment": "Dumbbell", "images": ["https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/61/Male/l/61_1.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/61/Male/m/61_1.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/61/Male/l/61_2.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/61/Male/m/61_2.jpg"], "videos": ["https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54901l.mp4", "https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54031l.mp4"]}, {"workoutName": "Single-Leg Box Jump", "description": "1.

This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set a flat bench behind you and set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, bring your arms up under the bar while keeping the elbows high and the upper arm slightly above parallel to the floor. Rest the bar on top of the deltoids and cross your arms while grasping the bar for total control.\n2.  Lift the bar off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3.  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (**Note:** For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances described in the foot positioning section).\n4.  Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you touch the bench with your glutes. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5.  Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor mainly with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position.\n6.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The front squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly. This version of the squat is better suited for advanced athletes.\n\n**Variations:** As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.", "diagram": "https://artifacts.bbcomcdn.com/@bbcom/exercises-app/2.1.2/img/guide-7.gif", "muscle": "Quadriceps", "equipment": "Barbell", "images": ["https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/59/Male/l/59_1.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/59/Male/m/59_1.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/59/Male/l/59_2.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/exercises/exerciseImages/sequences/59/Male/m/59_2.jpg"], "videos": ["https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/28000/29311l.mp4", "https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/54000/54091l.mp4"]}, {"workoutName": "Single-Leg Lateral Hop", "description": "1.

These pads will prevent your body from being raised by the resistance attached to the bar.\n2.  Grab the bar with the palms facing forward using the prescribed grip. **Note on grips:** For a wide grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance wider than your shoulder width. For a medium grip, your hands need to be spaced out at a distance equal to your shoulder width and for a close grip at a distance smaller than your shoulder width.\n3.  As you have both arms extended in front of you holding the bar at the chosen grip width, bring your torso and head forward. Think of an imaginary line from the center of the bar down to the back of your neck. This is your starting position.\n4.  As you breathe out, bring the bar down until it touches the back of your neck by drawing the shoulders and the upper arms down and back. **Tip:** Concentrate on squeezing the back muscles once you reach the full contracted position. The upper torso should remain stationary and only the arms should move. The forearms should do no other work except for holding the bar; therefore do not try to pull down the bar using the forearms.\n5.  After a second on the contracted position squeezing your shoulder blades together, slowly raise the bar back to the starting position when your arms are fully extended and the lats are fully stretched.

This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first place a flat bench or a box behind you. The flat bench is used to teach you to set your hips back and to hit depth.\n\n3.  Then, set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n4.  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n5.  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (**Note:** For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance described above which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n6.  Begin to slowly lower the bar by bending the knees and sitting your hips back as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until you slightly touch the bench behind you. Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n7.  Begin to raise the bar as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot as you straighten the legs and extend the hips to go back to the starting position.\n8.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** This is not an exercise to be taken lightly. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more. The squat is a very safe exercise but only if performed properly.\n\n**Variations:** As previously mentioned, there are various stances that can be used depending on what you want to emphasize.\n\nYou can also place a small block under the heels to improve balance.\n\nDumbbells can be used as well for resistance by holding them to your sides. The use of wrist wraps is a necessity due to the amount of weights used. I find this an excellent variation when my lower back begins to act up after many weeks of regular barbell squats. (**Note:** For wide stance dumbbell squats you will have to hold the dumbbells in between your legs as opposed to both sides in order to be able to distance your legs sufficiently).\n\nAnother way to perform these is by using a smith machine though I do not recommend this. The reason for not performing regular squats on the smith machine is that since the machine allows you to execute the exercise while leaning versus the bar, hip flexor involvement is minimized taking the hamstring out of the exercise. While this does take pressure off the lower back, hamstring involvement is a requirement to stabilize the knee-cap. So, as a result, what is created is a situation where destructive forces place a huge stress on the ACL (anterior cruciate ligament; a primary ligament in the knee capsule whose job is to provide knee stability) by pushing the knee-cap forward. For this reason, I highly recommend against smith machine use for squats and if you still insist on doing so, make sure it is a sporadic use rather than frequent, and also be sure to control the amount of weight used.\nThe barbell back squat to box takes a classic compound exercise for developing the lower body and adds the box element.

Inhale and then forcefully and quickly extend your hips and knees and stand on your toes.\n2.  Keep the bar as close to your body as possible. **Tip:** Your back should be flat with the elbows pointed out to the sides and your head in a neutral position.

Exhale during this movement.\n5.  Stand up by extending the hips and knees to a fully erect position.\n\n**Phase 6: Downward Movement Phase**\n\n1.  Lower the bar by gradually reducing the muscular tension of the arms to allow a controlled descent of the bar to the thighs. Inhale during this movement.\n2.

This exercise is best performed inside a squat rack for safety purposes. To begin, first set the bar on a rack that best matches your height. Once the correct height is chosen and the bar is loaded, step under the bar and place the back of your shoulders (slightly below the neck) across it.\n2.  Hold on to the bar using both arms at each side and lift it off the rack by first pushing with your legs and at the same time straightening your torso.\n3.  Step away from the rack and position your legs using a shoulder width medium stance with the toes slightly pointed out. Keep your head up at all times as looking down will get you off balance and also maintain a straight back. This will be your starting position. (Note: For the purposes of this discussion we will use the medium stance which targets overall development; however you can choose any of the three stances discussed in the foot stances section).\n4.  Begin to lower the bar by bending the knees as you maintain a straight posture with the head up. Continue down until the angle between the upper leg and the calves becomes slightly less than 90-degrees (which is the point in which the upper legs are below parallel to the floor). Inhale as you perform this portion of the movement. **Tip:** If you performed the exercise correctly, the front of the knees should make an imaginary straight line with the toes that is perpendicular to the front. If your knees are past that imaginary line (if they are past your toes) then you are placing undue stress on the knee and the exercise has been performed incorrectly.\n5.  Begin to raise the bar as fast as possible without involving momentum as you exhale by pushing the floor with the heel of your foot mainly as you straighten the legs again and go back to the starting position. **Note:** You should perform these exercises as fast as possible but without breaking perfect form and without involving momentum.\n6.  Repeat for the recommended amount of repetitions.\n\n**Caution:** This is not an exercise to be taken lightly due to the speed that it requires. If you have back issues, substitute it with the dumbbell squat variation or a leg press instead. If you have a healthy back, ensure perfect form and never slouch the back forward as this can cause back injury. Be cautious as well with the weight used; in case of doubt, use less weight rather than more.\nThe barbell speed squat targets the lower-body muscle groups using lighter weights to perform fast-paced back squats. Speed squats are popular in certain powerlifting training methodologies as a way to engrain form and lifting speed that can carry over to max-effort lifts. In this approach, they are usually performed in numerous sets of 3-5 reps with adequate rest in between. Speed squats are also sometimes performed with bands or chains adding extra resistance to the top half of the lift.", "diagram": "https://artifacts.bbcomcdn.com/@bbcom/exercises-app/2.1.2/img/guide-7.gif", "muscle": "Quadriceps", "equipment": "Barbell", "images": ["https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/originals/xdb-55b-barbell-speed-squat-m1-16x9.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/cropped/xdb-55b-barbell-speed-squat-m1-square.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/originals/xdb-55b-barbell-speed-squat-m2-16x9.jpg", "https://www.bodybuilding.com/images/2020/xdb/cropped/xdb-55b-barbell-speed-squat-m2-square.jpg"], "videos": ["https://content.jwplatform.com/videos/h4jhEMQU-1zuboWt3.mp4", "https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/32000/32561l.mp4", "https://videos.bodybuilding.com/video/mp4/40000/41351l.mp4"]}, {"workoutName": "Elbows Back", "description": "1.
